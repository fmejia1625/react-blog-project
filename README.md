# My static blog website using React

The link to my project can be found here hosted on Hiroku:

## Developing the app

The goal was to create an application that can be utilized by users in order to view, post, and interact with the main site. I first began by outlining the structure of my app by organzing the components and stylesheets. I envisioned my file structure by creating a component and then importing its respective stylesheet.

## File structure

- Step one: Creating a components folder.

- Step two: Creating a Nav.jsx component and a Nav.css for styling.

- Step three: Creating a seperate folder named pages which contains the components for Home, Contact, Blog posts and SignUp.

- Step four: Inside the App js is where the routers are used. The Nav and Footer components are located within the router tags and inside the switch tags, the paths to each component are passed in.

- Step five: Created components for Landing page, card holder, and card items along with css styling. Photos are stored inside img folder.

- Step six: Created footer component.

## Issues to resolve in the future

I intended to make the application more interactive by utilizing a form for the user to input information to local storage but due to time constraints, was unable to fulfill this requirement. I did manage to make use of fetching random user data from an API and rendering it on the signup component. Further issues to resolve in the future also include adding more content to the content and blogpost components.
